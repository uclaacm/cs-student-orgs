# Tech Student Organizations | CS at UCLA (WIP)

*This document is still in progress! It'll be ready on Tuesday, Sept 21st - we promise :)*

This is a community-driven resource for all of the tech-related student organizations at UCLA! We wrote this document specifically for the [CS Welcome Day](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/cs-welcome-day/), though the goal of this document is to be continually updated throughout the year.

[If you'd like, view this on a website instead.](https://uclaacm.github.io/cs-student-orgs/)

## I'm a student. How do I use this doc?

Check out the [**the total clubs list**](#the-list) or the [**upcoming fall events**](#upcoming-fall-events) to see general meetings and info sessions for clubs!

Then, feel free to browse the clubs by category:

## Resources and Thanks

This document was inspired by the [Welcome to UCLA CS - 2020](https://medium.com/techatucla/welcome-to-ucla-cs-2020-780f667d469c) article written by Katherine Chong, then the EVP of [ACM at UCLA](https://uclaacm.com). It was written for the 2020 CS Welcome Day.

This document is the brainchild of Kendrake Tsui, the CS Advocacy Director for [UPE](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/). [Matt Wang](https://matthewwang.me), the president of [ACM at UCLA](https://uclaacm.com), set up the technical details; Spurthi Rallapalli, the Student Relations Director and Lobbying Director for [SWE at UCLA](https://www.swe-ucla.com/), helped fill out a significant portion of the information.
