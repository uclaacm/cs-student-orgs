# Hardware-focused Orgs

Tired of coding and computer screens or has hardware ever interested you? You should definitely check out these EE clubs!

## [IEEE](http://ieeebruins.com/)

Our award winning student branch here at UCLA was founded in 1963. We have devoted our energies towards bringing hands-on, practical experiences to engineering students throughout the campus, as well as creating opportunities for students to interact with industry professionals, develop their professional skills and more. This year, we are offering four year-long projects for students of various levels of knowledge: OPS/Open Project Space, Micromouse, Aircopter, and DAV/Digital Audio Visualizer! We also host IDEA Hacks, UCLAâ€™s largest hardware hackathon in January!

**Skills you will use/learn:**

Skills used will vary between projects, and will range from PCA Design with EAGLE to FPGA. Come to our Fall GM and Projects Infosession to learn more about each project!

**Beginner friendly?**

Yes! OPS (Open Project Space) is a year-long project designed for complete beginners.

**How to reach out:**

Message our facebook page @ IEEE at UCLA!

## [Unmanned Aerial Systems at UCLA](https://uasatucla.org/)

UAS@UCLA designs and builds autonomous drones. Those include fixed-wing and multi-rotor drones used for competitions such as a mock search-and-rescue mission, or high endurance challenge, or more advanced topics and research areas.

**Skills you will use/learn:**

Controls theory, Simulation, RF engineering, machine vision recognition. Primary languages used are C, C++, and Python

**Beginner friendly?**

We are beginner-friendly! We require no previous experience or application, and allow members to join one of four subteams (airframe, ground, vision/AI, controls) where they will be given mentorship and tasks set to their skill level/ experience.

**How to reach out:**

We have a form on our website, or reaching out to our email, unmannedsystems.ucla@gmail.com are the fastest ways to join the organization
