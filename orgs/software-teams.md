## [LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com/live)

[LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com/live) is one of Southern California’s biggest hackathons, bringing over 1000 students to Pauley Pavilion for 36 hours of innovation, creativity and execution. Such a large event is only possible through the efforts of a fantastic organizing team. This ranges from people working in Sponsorships, Finance, Hacker Experience, Dev and much more. This team grows to become your family for the entire year, going through ups and downs like you’ve never experienced before, all to climax into one hell of an event.

**Skills you will use/learn:**

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (React)
Backed: Golang
Services: Python, C++, essentially anything that could contribute to a meaningful service that integrates well with the core backend

**Beginner Friendly:**

For most of our developer focused projects we would like to see prior experience in frontend technologies (from basics to frameworks), backend web development and/or mobile/VR experience. This therefore requires an intermediate level of knowledge, but we are always open to beginners that can show that they can learn quickly and get working.
